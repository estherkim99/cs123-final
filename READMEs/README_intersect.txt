Intersect Project

- Design decision:
All calculations for implicit functions for determining intersections with different type of objects are contained in rayshape folder. In this folder, RayCone, RayCube, RayCylinder and RaySphere inherit superclass RayShape.

In nested for loops, I iterate through every pixel of the canvas to update the new color generated for each pixel. The color is calculated after determining which object the ray generated by generateRays intersect with first. checkIntersect, which takes in a ray direction vector outputs the new color of the pixel. checkIntersect is the function where intersect checks are called from RayShape classes. As the function from Rayshape classes outputs normal vector of the first intersected object, lightEq is called to calculate the color of new pixel using light equation.


- Any known bugs:
Lighting appears darker.
